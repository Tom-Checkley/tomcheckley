			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<div class="about">
				<div class="about-text">
					<p><img src="images/profpic.jpg" class="insert-image">I provide one-to-one therapy with children with ASD in both the home and school setting. This therapy aims to teach and support communication, independence, motor skills, social skills (including theory of mind) and behavioural issues.<br> I work to devise and deliver individualised programmes for each client. The approach encompasses speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, positive behavioural support and is delivered with a person centred stance. I have also provided programmes in intensive interaction, relationship development and play therapy for clients.</p>

					<p>I currently work with young children and teenagers. <br> I have a person centred approach to my work with clients. I also work closely with the client’s parents, teaching staff and other therapists and have a great awareness of how important a good working relationship can be.<br> I have found it to be greatly beneficial to display counselling skills when working in these relationships, and ensure that individuals are heard and supported.<br> I also have a responsibility to understand boundaries and confidentiality issues in this role.</p>

				<h3>What is ABA</h3>
				<p><span>Applied behavior analysis (ABA)</span>, previously known as behavior modification, is defined as the process of systematically applying interventions based upon the principles of learning theory to improve socially significant behaviors to a meaningful degree, and to demonstrate that the interventions employed are responsible for the improvement of behavior. Contrary to popular belief, behavior analysts emphasize that the science of behavior must be a natural science as opposed to a social science. As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior to the environment, including antecedents and consequences, without resort to "hypothetical constructs". By functionally assessing the relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment, the methods of ABA can be used to change that behavior.<br><br>
				Methods in applied behavior analysis range from validated intensive behavioral interventions—most notably utilized for children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-to basic research which investigates the rules by which humans adapt and maintain behavior.</p>
