				<h1>Nicola Burns ABA Therapy</h1>
				<P>
					I mocked this site up for a friends Therapy business. Again it is one of my earlier creations. It used some slightly more advanced Javascript than I had used at the time. I had to use if statements for screen size to decide whether the navigation bar should slide up or not. I also built it with a panelled layout, with the last panel becoming a footer on larger device viewport widths.
