				<h1>Tom Checkley Web Development</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						This site is my most recent. I have made many, many versions and never been quite happy with them. I have finally settled on a design (for now). I've used a lot of techniques that I have used in other sites previously, and also learned some new ones. For example the parallax nav bar at the top of the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						I made fallbacks for devices not showing Javascript, and used some new technologies such as background blend mode with javascrip fallbacks for browsers not currently supporting.
					</p>
					<p>
						The site utilises the 12 column grid system I developed with bones. It also uses flexbox, which looking at can I use seems to be virtually fully supported with prefixes in older browsers.
