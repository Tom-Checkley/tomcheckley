			<h1>Tom Checkley Web Development</h1>
			<p>
				This site is my most recent. I have made many, many versions and never been quite happy with them. I have finally settled on a design (for now). I've used a lot of techniques that I have used in other sites previously, and also learned some new ones. For example the parallax nav bar at the top of the page.
