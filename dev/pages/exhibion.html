				<h1>Exhibion</h1>
				<P>
					Exhibion (and yes, the spelling is correct!) is a local artist who heard about me through a mutual friend. He asked me to create him a site on fairly short notice for an upcoming exhibition of his work. 
				</P>
				<p>
					It was fun to work on and test myself under pressure. It also gave me a good insight into working with a 'proper' client, especially as the design was changed a number of times before the due date.
				</P>
				<p>
					I used a few new techniques on this site as well as my Bones framework. The gallery was more complicated than I think it necessarily needed to be, however it was interesting to use jQuery .data to populate the information on the lightbox view.

						Tom created a wonderful artists website for me in under two weeks. I had an important exhibition on at the time so I changed my mind over the layout and features multiple times, none the less Tom literally worked day and night to code my ever changing vision. I am immensely grateful to him for this and would not hesitate to recommend his service. He is a well motivated, professional designer with a promising career ahead of him.
