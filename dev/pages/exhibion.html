				<h1>Exhibion</h1>
				<P>
					Exhibion (and yes, the spelling is correct!) is a local artist who heard about me through a mutual friend. He asked me to create him a site on fairly short notice for an upcoming exhibition of his work. 
				</P>
				<p>
					It was fun to work on and test myself under pressure. It also gave me a good insight into working with a 'proper' client, especially as the design was changed a number of times before the due date.
				</P>
				<p>
					I used a few new techniques on this site as well as my Bones framework. The gallery was more complicated than I think it necessarily needed to be, however it was interesting to use jQuery .data to populate the information on the lightbox view.
