				<h1>Stephen Sheppard Hairdressing</h1>
				<P>
					This is the first site I ever started. I used it as a way of practicing different techniques, after leaving it for a while while I practiced different things, I went back to it, and learnt the importance of writing neat code. I showed Stephen the site and he really liked it. 
				</P>
				<p>
					It taught me a number of different teqniques. The idea of mdile first, some Javascript with the map. JQuery for the drop down menu and hiding / showing various items at different screen sizes.
