				<h1>Stephen Sheppard Hairdressing</h1>
				<div>
					<P>
						This is the first site I ever started, Stephen is a friend whos business I used as a way of practicing different techniques and getting a feel for building a site that did more than say Hello World and Lorem Ipsum!
					</P>
					<p>
						After leaving it for a while while I practiced different things Stephen asked to see it, and liked the idea so, I went back to it, and learnt the importance of writing neat code. It was a mess! After tidying it up we went live.
					</P>
					<p>
						It taught me a number of different techniques. The idea of mobile first, some Javascript with the map. JQuery for the drop down menu and hiding / showing various items at different screen sizes.
