				<h1>Jeff Goldblum Movie Quiz</h1>
				<h2>A project using Javascript objects</h2>
				<div>
					<P>
						This was an experiment using Javascript to create a quiz based on films by the living legend Jeff Goldblum! I used constructor functions and prototypes to control the quiz, populating the html with each question, keeping track of the score, changing the message at the end of the quiz depending on the score.
					</P>
					<p>
						I wanted each question with 4 multiple choice answer buttons. I also wanted the possible answers to be populated at random from all possible answers in the quiz. I did this by creating an array with all the possible answers in the quiz and building a function that picked 3 random incorrect answers. Then inserting them in a random order
