					<P>
						This is one of the more recent sites I was commissioned to build. It was the first time I've used PHP. I used the Bones framework that I have been developing, and fairly simple AJAX requests for the gallery.

					<p>
						I also used flexbox and Modernizr to add checks for support. At the same time I fell in love with Flexbox!
